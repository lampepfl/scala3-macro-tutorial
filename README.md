# Scala 3 Macro Tutorial

This tutorial covers all the features involved in writing macros in Scala 3.
We will start with the new `inline` feature which is the entry point of all macros.
We also cover some meetaprogramming features that can be used with `inline`.
Then we learn how to create a macro using `inline` and quoted expressions.
We will have a look at the quoted expressions API and how to use them.
Finally, for those macros that need a bit more than expression, we will learn how to access thier typed AST.
